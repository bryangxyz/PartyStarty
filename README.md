## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites & Installing

1. Fork the repo and clone it to your development environment of choice.

2. To install apple(Me) dependencies, run the following command from the cloned repo's directory:

### Configuration

You will need several API Keys to run your own build of apply(Me). We use the NPM package [dotenv](https://github.com/motdotla/dotenv) for our local environment variables. You should make a .env file, placed in your clone's root directory, that looks like this:
